Arguments:
arg0: full path to input file.
arg1: max length or row.

Personal interpretations of the tasks unspecified areas:

Output file is created in the same directory as input file with timestamp in the name, in hopes of not having duplicate files.

Numbers are treated the same way as text and are not split if its possible to move the whole number to new line.
This is done to prevent the loss of information as it would be uncertain if originaly it was one number or not.

Space characters are removed after splitting the text so we dont have white space in begining of new lines.


The task took about 5 hours to complete.
